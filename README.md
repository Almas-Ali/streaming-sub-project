# PoC of Video Streaming using aiortc

Client to Server video streaming and saving the output in a file.

> [!NOTE]
> *Goal Note*: Build a sub project that allows multiple users to stream their camera feeds to our server. These streams will be stored for later analysis. If someone wants to see what others are streaming, they can view it.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the server first and then the client.

```bash
python server.py
python client.py
```
